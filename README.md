# storybook-minimal

An absolute minimal, standalone storybook app. Could be used to add a standalone storybook feature to existing apps that you don't want to share any config or dependencies with.

For example, you may want to use it with a percel, nextjs, remixjs app and you don't want conflicts with those build systems bc Storybook is very fragile.
